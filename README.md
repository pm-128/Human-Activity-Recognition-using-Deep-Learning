# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.
This dataset is collected from 30 persons performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. 
The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone.
